# `source/ui/` — Native UI

Rendered with **vita2d** (960×544). Default accent is the store green (`#3BFF00`); users can switch **color themes**, **UI fonts**, and **language** in Settings.

## Main surface

`FullCatalogScreen` covers:

- Full catalog grid and split detail view
- Catalog/startup loading overlays (splash art when configured)
- Settings (install method, PSP/PS1 target, PSP media, **language**, **UI font**, **color theme**, plugin warnings, image warmup, self-update)
- Download / install progress and result overlays (success, failure, **Download cancelled**, ZIP complete)
- Install All wizard and mirror/link pickers
- Search and catalog switching
- News modal (`news.txt`)
- First-run / Settings **theme picker**
- Essential plugins modal and plugin **reboot** modal
- Report / data-request confirms

## Image cache v3

The UI image cache is implemented in `image_cache.cpp` / `image_cache.hpp` and is documented in detail in [`../../../docs/IMAGE_CACHE.md`](../../../docs/IMAGE_CACHE.md).

Current behaviour:

- Images are loaded **on demand** and reused from disk when present.
- Catalog-aware scopes are `H` (Homebrew), `PV` (PS Vita), `PSP`, and `PS1`.
- Each icon/cover/screenshot has a **stable resource identity** independent of its current URL.
- Cache files include both the stable resource identity and the current URL hash.
- App/icon/cover images are normalized with a maximum dimension of **128 px**; screenshots are normalized with a maximum dimension of **256 px**, preserving aspect ratio.
- If an image URL changes, the new version downloads first; after successful validation, only older versions of that **same resource** are removed.
- A changed icon cannot remove a cover or screenshot, and one catalog cannot remove another catalog's images.
- Resource files are spread over **256 buckets** under `ux0:data/psvitaalive/cache/images/v3/` so per-image replacement does not scan the whole cache.
- Existing `/app_` and `/shot_` path classification remains compatible with the texture-management logic in `FullCatalogScreen`.
- UI-first scheduling defers new network image requests while catalog/detail scrolling is still animated, while allowing already-ready cached textures to continue loading under the one-texture-per-frame budget. Off-screen active image transfers are cancelled through the existing libcurl cancellation callback, and worker progress publication is limited to 10 Hz to reduce mutex pressure during navigation.

### Startup disk cap

Global cache-size maintenance happens **only at startup**, before the ImageCache worker is created:

```text
cache <= 200 MiB
→ no global eviction

cache > 200 MiB
→ remove oldest complete image files
→ leave approximately <= 40 MiB
```

The first pass only measures the cache and removes abandoned `.normalized` temporaries. The more expensive metadata collection + sort pass is created only when the 200 MiB limit has actually been exceeded.

Deletion is always whole-file `sceIoRemove()`; images are never truncated to hit an exact byte target. If a deletion fails, its size is not deducted from the running total.

### Startup progress UI

`ImageCache::init()` accepts a startup-maintenance callback. `main.cpp` maps the cache phases to the existing loading overlay:

```text
Checking image cache...
Cleaning old cached images...
Image cache ready
```

The overlay is redrawn with `FullCatalogScreen::updateAndDraw()` while maintenance runs. Progress is based on scanned buckets during checking and whole-file cleanup work during eviction—not partial bytes from an image file.

After startup maintenance, the normal image path is unchanged: an evicted image is simply a cache miss and downloads again when requested.

## Color themes

- Many distinct named palettes (`ColorTheme` in `app_settings.hpp`).
- First launch: theme grid before News (`theme_setup_done`).
- Settings opens the same grid (not a simple Left/Right cycle).
- **Preview then confirm:** first X/tap previews; second activation on the same theme **or** **Save** commits.
- **Cross-fade (~420 ms):** `applyColorTheme(..., animate)` interpolates BG, SURFACE*, PANEL, BORDER, TEXT, DIM, ACCENT* with smoothstep (`tickThemeBlend` in `updateAnimations`).
- Startup / config load uses `animate=false` (instant).
- Brand full-colour logo/splash only for **NeonLime / PsVitaAlive**; other themes use monochrome assets + accent tint.

## UI fonts

`ui_font.cpp` / `ui_font.hpp`:

| Style | Load path |
|-------|-----------|
| Default | `vita2d_load_default_pgf()` |
| Serif / Sans / bold variants | `sa0:data/font/ltn{0,2,4,6}.pgf` |

Config: `ui_font_style`. Missing system files fall back to Default.

## Multilanguage

Strings go through `LocalizationManager` + `TextId` + `app0:lang/*.lang`.

Currently packaged language files are:

```text
en, es, fr, de, it, pt-PT, pt-BR, ru
```

The internal language registry supports additional Vita languages, but a language is selectable only when its `.lang` asset is actually present.

Catalog JSON is not translated. See [`../../../docs/MULTILANGUAGE.md`](../../../docs/MULTILANGUAGE.md).

### Startup localization ordering

`LocalizationManager` is initialized in `main.cpp` immediately after installer/settings initialization and **before** image-cache startup maintenance. This allows the cache checking/cleaning messages to appear in the user's selected or System-resolved language before normal catalog loading begins.

The cache-maintenance strings have compatibility fallbacks for all currently packaged languages. If a `.lang` later defines those same keys, the normal `.lang` value wins.

## Progress overlay & lock messaging

While a download/install job is active:

- Phase hints (connecting, downloading, extracting, installing, retries)
- Large-type **LOCKED** banner: PS button and soft power menu disabled; screen stays on
- CIRCLE cancels (in progress) or acknowledges (result); other keys toast LOCKED
- Touch must match resized panels (do not leave hitboxes on old coordinates)

Startup image-cache maintenance uses the same loading-overlay infrastructure but is not an install/download lock state.

## Theme / News / Settings scroll

Theme picker and Settings list use the same **stepped touch scroll** model as the main catalog (drag moves focus like D-Pad). News uses its own line scroll.

## Catalog card text

Long titles use ellipsis / marquee with **parent clipping** so names do not spill outside card bounds while scrolling.

Install/update status badges follow the same ownership rule. `drawInstallBadge()` receives the clipping rectangle owned by its caller:

- catalog cards pass **card ∩ catalog panel**;
- the detail header passes the **detail panel**;
- badge background and breathing glow are clipped before drawing;
- long localized `BADGE_UPDATE` strings keep their marquee, but its scissor is intersected with the caller clip;
- after marquee drawing, the caller-owned clip is restored before returning.

This prevents localized labels such as `ACTUALIZACIÓN`, `AGGIORNAMENTO` or `ОБНОВЛЕНИЕ` from appearing above/below the catalog while a card is partially entering or leaving the viewport during smooth scrolling. Do not restore a badge marquee to full-screen clipping.

Update-state semantics, receipt compatibility and Vita `APP_VER` normalization are documented in [`../../../docs/UPDATE_DETECTION.md`](../../../docs/UPDATE_DETECTION.md).

## Plugin UI

- Link row: **Installed** badge when file (+ config line when required) already present; press → toast, no re-download
- Install All skips already-installed plugins
- Post-install **Restart required** modal blocks background touch until soft reset
- Essential plugins modal: large type, pulsing **Install plugins** border

## Settings INFO

INFO panel documents each focused option (install method, PSP target/media, language, font, theme, plugins, images, updates). SYSTEM block lists plugin detection status with larger type.

## Settings performance

Settings is deliberately **render-only after entry**. Opening Settings cancels queued/active catalog image work, snapshots plugin status once, and then renders the SYSTEM status block from RAM. `drawSettings()` must not call filesystem-backed plugin probes such as `essentialPluginFullyInstalled()` or `TaiConfigEditor::configContainsLine()` because those operations open/read `ur0:tai/config.txt` and can collapse frame rate on real hardware.

`updateAndDraw()` also skips `prepareVisibleTextures()` while `UiMode::SETTINGS` is active. Existing app textures remain resident in the bounded LRU and image preparation resumes automatically after Settings closes.

### D-pad navigation-aware image scheduler

`FullCatalogScreen` treats held UP/DOWN as continuous navigation even during the controller repeat delay. While navigation is busy it cancels image work once, starts no new network request or GPU decode, and keeps resident textures drawable. App textures that leave the viewport remain in the existing 18-entry LRU; off-screen screenshots are still released immediately.
